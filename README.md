# twitter-social-graph
Project to visualize a user's Twitter social graph

## Data Collection ##
Replace the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret in twitter_project.py with your own values.
Run twitter_project.py to begin data collection. This will take some time due to Twitter's API limits. 
## Build Graph ##
Run twitter_network.py to construct your Twitter social graph

The visualization is then taken care of by the net.js file, which uses D3.js
